# Inter-Process-communication-using-socket-programming-Implementing-multithreaded-echo-server

This is a simple client-server implementation of an echo server with multi-threaded support in C.

Objecttive:

  - Learn about the working and usage of threads in c and how multithreading works.
  - Learn about the concept of sockets and how they can be implemented in c.

The server.c file contains the code for server and can be compiled with command gcc -o server server.c -lpthread

The client-socket.c file contains the code for client and can be compiled with command gcc -o client client.c -lpthread

-Now fire the server with ./server command from terminal
